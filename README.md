# Generating Monet Style Pictures with CycleGAN


This project explores generative techniques utilizing CycleGAN to transform regular images into Monet-style artworks. By leveraging the power of generative models, the goal is to capture the distinctive artistic features of Monet's style and demonstrate the potential of generative models in different applications. We will use a dataset provided by Kaggle, which includes Monet paintings and regular photographs. The model will be trained on the Monet-style images to learn the distinct artistic features of Monet's work.
